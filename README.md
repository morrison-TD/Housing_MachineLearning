![Housing Prices](templates/Images/housing_prices.jpg)

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the 
basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset 
proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

 With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, 
 this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
